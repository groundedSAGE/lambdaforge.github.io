                  <h4>DISCLAIMER:</h4>
                  <h5>Liability for content</h5>
                  <p>
                      As a service provider, we are responsible according to § 7 para.1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG) for our own content on these pages according to the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 of the TMG, however, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. A liability in this regard, however, is only possible from the date of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of appropriate violations, we will remove this content immediately.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Liability for links</h5>
                  <p>
                      Our internet offer contains links to external websites of third parties over whose contents we have no influence. We cannot, therefore, assume any liability for these external contents. The provider or operator of the respective pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanently checking the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Copyright</h5>
                  <p>
                      The created content and work on these pages are subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, processing, distribution and any form of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are permitted for private, non-commercial use only. Wherever the contents of this site were not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are observed. In particular, content provided by third parties is marked as such. If you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, we ask you to advise us accordingly. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such content immediately.
